During the advanced phase of the Web Application Development (WAD) course, we will be focusing on back-
end web development with PHP Framework called **Laravel**. 
With this framework, we are going to create a **multiuser web application**
with ‚Äúdynamic‚Äù content containing **text and images** (reviews, recipes, live hacks, forum posts,
events, etc.)

### Learning goals

After completing this phase of the module we will be able to:
- Set up a development environment for Laravel web applications.
- Explain how the **MVC** is implemented and how it works.
- Use Composer (**package manager**).
- Use **Artisan** to enhance your development experience (**scaffolding, migration, cache cleaning**, etc.)
- Create an **environment configuration** file for the respective environments.
- Create a **controller** with actions with appropriate responses.
- Use **Blade** to create views, layouts and partial views. (**view engine**)
- Create a models.
- Bind a model to a form in the view.
- Implement **model validation** by making use of Laravel Validation class.
- Use **Eloquent** to query the database for models **(ORM)**.
- Use **migration** and **seeding** files to populate a database with tables and initial content.
- Create **authentication and authorization** functionality by making use of the built-in features of
Laravel. (example : `php artisan make:auth`)
- Create **file upload** functionalities in Laravel.


### Way of Working

The approach used in this course is **Learning-by-doing**, therefore this course is highly self-study oriented.
Besides classes, the student will have to spend a **minimum of 8 hours** (self-study) in the matter per week.
We must commit your work at least on weekly basis in
**GitLab**. It is important that you show consistent learning and improvement.


#### About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.


#### Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains over 1500 video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.


#### About Composer

Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.


#### About Artisan CLI

Laravel includes the Artisan CLI which handles many tasks

- Creating controller & models
- Creating database migration files and running migrations
- Creating providers, events, jobs, form requests, etc
- Show routes
- Session commands
- Run Tinker
- Create custom commands

 Artisan is the command-line interface included with Laravel. Artisan provides a number of helpful commands that can assist you while you build your application.
 
`$ php artisan list` 

`$ php artisan help migrate` 

`$ php artisan make:controller TodosController` *shoud be plural* 

`$ php artisan make:model Todo -m` *shoud be singular* 

`$ php artisan make:migration add_todos_to_db -table` 

`$ php artisan migrate` 

`$ php artisan tinker`


#### About Eloquent

Laravel includes the Eloquent object relational mapper

The Eloquent ORM included with Laravel provides a beautiful, simple ActiveRecord implementation for working with your database. Each database table has a corresponding "Model" which is used to interact with that table. Models allow you to query for data in your tables, as well as insert new records into the table.

- Makes querying & working with the DB very easy 
- We can still use raw SQL queries if needed


#### About Blade

Blade is the simple, yet powerful templating engine provided with Laravel. Blade view files use the `.blade.php` file extension and are typically stored in the 'resources/views' directory. Two of the primary benefits of using Blade are template *inheritance* and *sections*.

Blade Template Engine do handles many tasks

- Adding dynamic components
- Creating custom components
